# DuckDuckGo

Personally I use DuckDuckGo because I don't want to be tracked but I was wondering how secure it is? So, I read through the entire privacy policy and here is what I gathered.

## Privacy Policy Simplefied

Sensitive Info: 

  DuckDuckGo only temperaraly tracks whats given to it, most browsers automatticaly send your 'IP address, browser type, and language' amoung other things (according to DuckDuckGo) and what is tracked cannot be traced back to you and is not written to a disc

Search and Browsing:

  Once again DuckDuckGo only temperaraly tracks your Search and Browing history and what is tracked cannot be traced back to you and is not written to a disc

## Final Verdict

The rest of the Privacy Policy talks about how DuckDuckGo tries to make it harder for other things to track you and how it in fact does not

Tracking: 2/10

Data Sold: 0/10

<br/>

Total Privacy: 9/10

<br/>

I would defiinitly recemend DuckDuckGo if you want a private search engine
