# Google

Google is the most widely-used search engine, but it isn't known for it's privacy. How private does it claim to be?

## Privacy Policy Simplefied

Sensitive Info: 

  Google collects of lot of sensitive info to bring personalised services, optimised experiences, all whilst ensuring privacy of their products. 
  While it does try to protect against threats like hacks, they use your data to send you ads, selling your data along the way. They do this _a lot_.

Search and Browsing:

  Google collects your searches and history, whether you delete it or not, and uses that to make money. By selling it.

## Final Verdict

Google is greedy, and while trying to stay secure, they also steal your data because money. I am not making this lower only because the browser can block tracking themself if they have the capibilities.

Tracking: 7/10

Data Sold: 8/10

Total Privacy: 4/10

Probably don't use this.
